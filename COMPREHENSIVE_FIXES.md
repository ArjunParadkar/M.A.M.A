# Comprehensive Fixes for Maker Dashboard

## Issues Identified:
1. Total profit showing 90,000 (wrong calculation)
2. Workflow calendar only shows devices with tasks (need ALL devices)
3. Ongoing services click should go to ongoing services page
4. Remove View Details/Extended Description buttons
5. Add long-term commissions to ongoing services
6. Add status indicators (running on device, needs work, paused)
7. Make recommendations clickable with accept/decline
8. Financials page needs password (123456) and charts
9. Materials ordering indicator needed
10. Device maintenance indicators needed

This file will be used to track implementation.
