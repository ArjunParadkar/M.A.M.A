# M.A.M.A AI Models Requirements

# Core ML Libraries
# NOTE: scikit-learn/pandas are great for training, but are hard to install on Python 3.13 in many envs.
# For this demo, the runtime does not require them (we use lightweight heuristic scoring).
# Use Python 3.11/3.12 if you want to enable scikit-learn/pandas training/inference.
